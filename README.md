# Evolution Simulation

A Python-based evolution simulation where animals compete for survival in a virtual ecosystem. The simulation features:

- Herbivores and carnivores with different behaviors
- Plant resources that grow and regenerate
- Movement and hunting logic for different species
- Visual representation of the ecosystem

## Technical Stack

### Core Simulation (Python)
- Animal behavior and logic
- Plant growth systems
- Evolution mechanics
- Ecosystem rules

### Graphics/Visualization Options

1. **Pygame**
   - Pros: Simple to learn, good for 2D graphics, built for games
   - Cons: Basic graphics, limited to 2D
   
2. **Arcade**
   - Pros: Modern Python library, good documentation, easier than Pygame
   - Cons: Less community support than Pygame

3. **PyOpenGL**
   - Pros: 3D capable, professional graphics
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve

## Recommended Approach
For this type of simulation, **Pygame** would be the best choice because:
- Easy to create simple shapes for animals and plants
- Good performance for 2D simulations
- Large community and many learning resources
- Simple to implement collision detection
- Works well with Python's core libraries
